# Cryptography
## Basic decoding
* hexadecimal: 2 digits per unit of meaning; often starts with 0x; consists of
  letters from alphabet `0123456789abcdef`
* base64: length is divisible by 4; often padded with `==`
* [ascii codes to ascii characters](https://convert.town/ascii-to-text)
* octal: base 8; just use CyberChef
* substitution cipher: letters are replaced by other letters; quipqiup is good
  at automatically decoding substitution ciphers
    * Caesar cipher (aka rot13): shift the alphabet by some number; e.g., with a shift of 3,
      A becomes D, B becomes E
    * atbash: A becomes Z, B becomes Y, etc.
    * vigenere: you have to have a key

    * [qwerty fingers on dvorak keyboard](http://wbic16.xedoloh.com/dvorak.html)
* railfence: rearrange text in a wave pattern (up and down) and read from left
  to right
* Morse code: try a lot of different online decoders, and make sure to check for
  caps, etc.

## Actual decryption
* md5: 128-bit output (32 ascii chars); easily hackable using dictionary attacks
  like john the ripper with `rockyou.txt`
    * [passwordrecovery.io](https://passwordrecovery.io/md5): md5 hash cracker;
      it'll compare your hash against hashes from `rockyou.txt` very quickly
* [getting started with john the ripper](https://www.tunnelsup.com/getting-started-cracking-password-hashes/)
* [hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat)
    * If you know part of the plaintext of a hash, then use [mask attack](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack)
    * Download and unzip and make as necessary
    * Make a mask file. In this case, we know the plaintext is
      `FLAG-HQNT-?d?d?d?d` where `?d` indicates some numerical digit, so create
      a `file.hcmask` with that string in it. Then run `./hashcat -a 3 -m 0
      --show ../All\ Ctfs/NCLFall2019/md5masked-file.hcmask`
* [hash toolkit for md5, sha1, sha256, sha512](https://hashtoolkit.com)
* [NTLM aka ntHash](https://medium.com/@petergombos/lm-ntlm-net-ntlmv2-oh-my-a9b235c58ed4):
  Windows hash system
    * `./john --format=netntlmv2 NAME.txt`

    * [RsaCtfTool](https://github.com/RsaCtfTool/RsaCtfTool): can do lots of
      attacks
    * [My explanation of RSA](rsa.md)
* [encrypted pdfs](https://ctftime.org/writeup/8707): `pdfcrack
  --wordlist=rockyou.txt NAME.pdf`
* shadow and passwd file dehashing
    * [shadow format](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-security-4/etc-shadow-file-663816): `$1$IwCH$c5VgaFQG9VZdL1UnWDUmj0`
        * The part between the first two “$”s is the type of algorithm used (1
          indicates MD5)
        * The second part is the salt
        * The third part is the hash itself
        * `touch` a text file and fill it with the salt and the hash as given in
          the shadow document
        * Use john the ripper: `./john/run/john --format=md5crypt-opencl
          --wordlist=../../rockyou.txt dumps.txt`
    * `./john/run/unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > passwords.txt`
    * `./john/run/john --format=md5crypt-opencl --wordlist=../../rockyou.txt
      passwords.txt`

## Steganography: hiding messages in files
* [0xRick's list of tools/resources](https://0xrick.github.io/lists/stego): some
  person's
* [First steps cheatsheet](https://pequalsnp-team.github.io/cheatsheet/steganography-101)
* `binwalk flag.png`
    * If you see something interesting, extract it with `unzip flag.png`
* `foremost`
* Check plaintext sections with `cat`, `strings`, and/or `hexdump -C` or `xxd` (shows both binary and hexdump)
* Image metadata
	* `exiftool`
    * `mdls`
* stegsolve
* steghide
* Check file's [magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures)
  to make sure it is what its file extension says it is
