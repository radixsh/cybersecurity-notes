# CTF notes
My first attempt to collect cybersecurity resources and create explanatory notes
for myself. I remember things best when I teach them to myself.

### To do
- [x] Transfer notes from Google Drive to here
- [ ] Transfer links from my years-old bookmarks list here
- [ ] Annotate said links

### Web exploitation
* How to examine HTTP request made when a purchase is made: Inspect
  (Ctrl+Shift+i) < Network, then reload and select any HTTP request on the left
  panel to display it on the right.
* SQL injection
    * To view database: try just typing a space to bring up all names with a
      space (which is all of them, since each entry is `firstName lastName`.
      This is (probably) the SQL being used: `'SELECT name, type FROM USERS
      WHERE name LIKE "%' + query + '%";', so run 1"; SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE
      "%"="`
    * To try to log in: put `' or 1=1 --` as your username#
* dirbuster

### Miscellaneous tips and tricks
* To search for a file by a string in the filename (in the current directory and
  one directory down): `find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*foobar*" -print`
* To find the n most frequent terms in a file: `sed -e 's/\s/\n/g' < test.txt |
  sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head  -10 `
