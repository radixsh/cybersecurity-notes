# CTF notes 
My first attempt to collect cybersecurity resources and create explanatory notes
for myself. I remember things best when I teach them to myself.

Factorization attack: if we know `N`, `p`, and `q`, then we can find the private
key `d` and the totient function `phi(n)` which will give us access to the
message.

ciphertext = plaintext to the power of public exponent, mod product of two
large primes

> `c = m^e, mod n`

plaintext = ciphertext to the power of private exponent, mod the same product
as before

> `m = c^d, mod n`

How to turn ciphertext into plaintext given product `n` and public exponent `e`:

1. Given product `n`, use factorDB.py to find prime factors `p` and `q`:
   `python3 factorDB.py YOUR_N_HERE`
2. Find totient function, which counts the positive ints up to `n` that are
   relatively prime to `n`: `phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)`
3. Given exponent `e`, find private key `d`: `d = inverse(e, phi)`
4. The decrypted message is **c to the power of d, modulus n**: `m = pow(c, d,
   n)`

(Sometimes decimal to ascii is difficult; CyberChef won't be able to do it, but
[onlineasciitools](https://onlineasciitools.com/convert-decimal-to-ascii) can
decode decimal to ascii without a clear delimiter. This was also identifiable as
requiring hex to ascii decoding because 123 is `{` and 125 is `}`.)
